The nursing theory of Carmelita C Divinagracia is a model that guides nurses in providing culturally competent care to diverse populations. Divinagracia, a Filipino nurse educator and researcher, developed her theory based on her experiences and observations of nursing practice in the Philippines and other countries. She proposed that nursing care should be holistic, humanistic, and transcultural, and that nurses should respect and value the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of their clients.

The main concepts of Divinagracia's theory are culture, health, illness, wellness, and nursing. Culture is defined as the shared patterns of behavior, beliefs, values, norms, symbols, and meanings that influence the way people think, feel, and act. Health is a state of physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being that is influenced by culture. Illness is a deviation from health that is perceived and interpreted by the individual and the culture. Wellness is a dynamic process of achieving health through adaptation and harmony with the environment. Nursing is a caring profession that assists individuals, families, groups, and communities in attaining health and wellness through culturally congruent interventions.
 
Divinagracia's theory proposes that nursing care should be based on four principles: cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and cultural competence. Cultural awareness is the recognition and appreciation of one's own culture and the culture of others. Cultural knowledge is the acquisition and understanding of factual information about the culture of the client. Cultural sensitivity is the ability to empathize and communicate effectively with people from different cultures. Cultural competence is the integration and application of cultural awareness, knowledge, and sensitivity in planning and delivering nursing care that meets the needs and expectations of the client.
 
The nursing theory of Carmelita C Divinagracia provides a framework for nurses to enhance their cultural competence and improve the quality of care for diverse populations. By using this theory, nurses can respect the uniqueness of each client, acknowledge the influence of culture on health and illness, and provide care that is congruent with the client's cultural values and preferences.

To illustrate how Divinagracia's theory can be applied in nursing practice, here are some examples of culturally competent nursing care[^1^] [^2^]:
 
- Using language and terms that patients understand. If the patient speaks another language, making sure a medical interpreter is present. Asking a family member to translate may not be enough.
- Respecting patients' cultural and religious beliefs that conflict with treatment plans. For example, if a patient refuses blood transfusion due to religious reasons, exploring alternative options and respecting the patient's decision.
- Asking patients about their preferences and expectations regarding pain management, comfort measures, and end-of-life care. For example, some cultures may prefer natural remedies or spiritual practices over medication or invasive procedures.
- Being aware of the role of family and community in the patient's health and illness. For example, some cultures may value collective decision-making or family involvement in care delivery.
- Adapting nursing interventions to suit the patient's cultural needs and values. For example, modifying dietary plans, dressing styles, or hygiene practices to accommodate the patient's preferences.

By following these examples, nurses can demonstrate cultural competence and provide nursing care that is holistic, humanistic, and transcultural.
