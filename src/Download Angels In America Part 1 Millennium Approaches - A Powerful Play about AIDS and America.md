Angels In America Part 1: Millennium Approaches is the first half of a two-part play by Tony Kushner that explores the lives of several characters in New York City during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s.

The play also tackles themes such as identity, sexuality, religion, history, and justice.
 
The play premiered on Broadway in 1993 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play. It has been widely acclaimed as one of the most important and influential works of American theater in the 20th century. It has been adapted into an HBO miniseries starring Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, and Emma Thompson, and a National Theatre Live production starring Andrew Garfield, Nathan Lane, and Russell Tovey.

- Louis Ironson, Prior's lover who abandons him out of fear and guilt and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt.
- Joe Pitt, a closeted gay Mormon lawyer who works for Roy Cohn and struggles with his faith and marriage.
- Harper Pitt, Joe's wife who suffers from agoraphobia and Valium addiction and escapes into imaginary worlds.
- Roy Cohn, a powerful and corrupt lawyer who is also secretly gay and dying of AIDS but denies his condition.
- Belize, a former drag queen and nurse who is Prior's friend and Roy's caretaker.
- Hannah Pitt, Joe's mother who comes to New York to help her son after he comes out to her.
- The Angel, a celestial being who appears to Prior and claims to be the voice of God.

The play is full of historical and cultural references, such as the Reagan administration, the Cold War, McCarthyism, Mormonism, Judaism, immigration, racism, homophobia, and more. It also features surreal elements, such as ghosts, hallucinations, dreams, and metaphors. The play challenges the audience to confront the complex realities of human existence and the possibility of change and redemption.

The play has received critical acclaim and numerous awards for its originality, relevance, and impact. Many reviewers have praised the play's exploration of the human condition, its blend of humor and tragedy, its rich language and symbolism, and its superb performances by various actors over the years. Some of the most notable reviews are:

> "'Millenium Approaches' may not be as visually striking as 'Perestroika', but it manages to have the right amount of not going over the top that it becomes overblown or being so minimal it looks under-budgeted. The dialogue provokes a lot of thought and amuses, moves and intrigues."[^4^]

> "At Arena Stage, director Janos Szasz finds dazzling visual metaphors for Tony Kushnerâs monumental play about the AIDS crisis. [...] This audaciously ingenious and zeitgeist-changing interpretation by famed international film and theater Director JÃ¡nos SzÃ¡sz is like a punch in the psychic gut as we are simultaneously propelled into a sensory world of imagery and symbolism that evokes the subconscious psyche as the characters in the play [...] evoke differing aspects of the mind."[^2^]

> "In the tighter, tauter first play, Millennium Approaches, Kushner certainly captures the fear and uncertainty caused by the Aids crisis: this is 1985, and many of the characters are in a state of sexual denial. [...] But what makes Kushnerâs play so remarkable is that it transcends its immediate context. It is not just about Aids or gay rights; it is also about universal questions of life and death, love and betrayal, heaven and hell."[^5^]
