If you want to add two Serial ATA ports to your PC, you might be interested in the Sweex 2 Port Serial Ata Pci Card Pu102. This card allows you to connect two SATA devices, such as hard drives or optical drives, internally or externally. In this article, we will show you how to install and use this card on your Windows PC.
 
## Installation Steps
 
1. Turn off your PC and disconnect it from the power source. Also, disconnect any peripherals that have their own power supply, such as the monitor and printer.
2. Open the computer case and find a free PCI slot on the motherboard. Remove the metal cover plate that blocks the slot.
3. Touch a metal part of the case to discharge any static electricity from your body. Avoid touching any components on the card or the motherboard.
4. Insert the card into the PCI slot and press it firmly until it snaps into place. Secure it with a screw if needed.
5. Close the computer case and reconnect all the cables.
6. Turn on your PC and wait for Windows to detect the new hardware.
7. Insert the driver CD that came with the card into your CD-ROM drive. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the driver. If you don't have the CD, you can download the driver from [here](https://drivers.softpedia.com/get/Other-DRIVERS-TOOLS/Others/Sweex-PU100-2-Port-Serial-ATA-PCI-Card-Driver.shtml).
8. Restart your PC when prompted.

## Usage Tips

- You can connect up to two SATA devices to the card, either internally or externally. The card has two SATA connectors on its back panel, and two SATA cables are included in the package.
- To connect an internal device, such as a hard drive or an optical drive, use one of the SATA cables to connect it to one of the SATA connectors on the card. Then, connect a power cable from your power supply to the device.
- To connect an external device, such as an external hard drive or an enclosure, use one of the SATA cables to connect it to one of the SATA connectors on the card. Then, connect a power adapter to the device if needed.
- You can use both internal and external devices at the same time, as long as you don't exceed two devices in total.
- You can access your SATA devices from Windows Explorer or any other application that supports them. You can also format, partition, or backup your SATA devices using Windows Disk Management or any other utility that supports them.
