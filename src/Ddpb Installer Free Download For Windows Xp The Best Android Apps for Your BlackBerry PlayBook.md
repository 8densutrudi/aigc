If you own a Blackberry Playbook and want to enjoy some Android apps on it, you can use a tool called DDPB Installer to sideload them onto your device. Sideload means to install apps from sources other than the official app store. DDPB Installer is a free software that lets you transfer Android apps in .bar format from your computer to your Playbook over a USB connection.
 
In this article, I will show you how to download and use DDPB Installer to sideload Android apps onto your Blackberry Playbook. You will need a Windows XP or later computer, a USB cable, and a Playbook with OS 2.0 or later.

## Step 1: Download DDPB Installer
 
You can download DDPB Installer from the Internet Archive[^1^]. It is a .zip file that contains the installer and some sample apps. Extract the .zip file to a folder on your computer and run the installer. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
 
## Step 2: Enable Development Mode on Your Playbook
 
Before you can sideload apps onto your Playbook, you need to enable development mode on it. This will allow you to connect your Playbook to your computer and install apps from DDPB Installer. To enable development mode, follow these steps:
 
- On your Playbook, swipe down from the top bezel and tap Settings.
- Tap Security and then Development Mode.
- Slide the switch to On and enter a password for your device. Remember this password as you will need it later.
- Tap OK to confirm.

## Step 3: Connect Your Playbook to Your Computer
 
Now that you have enabled development mode on your Playbook, you can connect it to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure your Playbook is turned on and unlocked. You should see a message on your Playbook screen that says "Connected to Computer".
 
## Step 4: Run DDPB Installer and Add Apps
 
On your computer, launch DDPB Installer from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You should see a window like this:

The first thing you need to do is enter the IP address and password of your Playbook. You can find the IP address by tapping About on your Playbook settings and then Network. The password is the one you set when you enabled development mode. Enter these information in the corresponding fields and click Connect.
 
If everything goes well, you should see a message that says "Connected" and some information about your Playbook below it. Now you can add apps to DDPB Installer by clicking Add and browsing for .bar files on your computer. You can find some sample apps in the folder where you extracted DDPB Installer or download more from online sources.
 
Once you have added all the apps you want to sideload, select them by checking the boxes next to their names and click Install. Wait for the installation process to finish and then disconnect your Playbook from your computer.
