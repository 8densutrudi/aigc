Final Fantasy XII is not only a game with a rich story and world, but also a game with a unique and innovative gameplay system. Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, Final Fantasy XII does not have random encounters or turn-based battles. Instead, it uses a system called Active Dimension Battle (ADB), which allows the player to control one character out of a party of three, while the other two are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI).
 
The player can switch between characters at any time, and can also issue commands to the other party members manually. The game also features a system called Gambits, which are preset rules that determine how the AI-controlled characters behave in combat. For example, a Gambit can be set to make a character heal another character when their HP falls below 50%, or to attack the enemy with the lowest HP. The player can customize and prioritize the Gambits for each character, creating different strategies for different situations.
 
The game also has a system called License Board, which is similar to the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. The License Board is a grid of nodes that contain various abilities, spells, equipment, and augmentations for each character. The player can use License Points (LP) earned from battles to unlock nodes on the board, allowing the characters to learn new skills and use new equipment. The Zodiac Age version of the game introduces a new feature called Zodiac Job System, which allows the player to assign each character one of 12 jobs, such as Knight, Black Mage, or Archer. Each job has its own License Board, which limits the abilities and equipment that the character can use.
