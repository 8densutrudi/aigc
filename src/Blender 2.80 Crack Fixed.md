One of the most noticeable changes in Blender 2.80 is the redesigned user interface. The new interface has a dark theme and modern icons that give it a sleek and professional look. The interface also puts more focus on the artwork that you create, by reducing clutter and distractions. You can customize the interface to suit your preferences and workflow, and switch between different workspaces for different tasks.
 
Another big change in Blender 2.80 is the introduction of Eevee, a new real-time render engine that lets you see your scene in high quality as you work on it. Eevee supports advanced features such as shadows, reflections, volumetrics, ambient occlusion, depth of field and more. You can use Eevee for previewing your scene, creating animations or even making final renders.
