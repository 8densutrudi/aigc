## Using H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7 with Debugging Software
 
Once you have installed and configured H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you can use it with various debugging software that support JTAG interface. Here are some examples of how to use it with some common debugging software:
 
### GNU GNAT
 
GNU GNAT is a free software development environment for Ada programming language. It supports ARM devices via JTAG interface. To use it with H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to download and install GNU GNAT from [this link](https://www.adacore.com/download). Then, you need to create a project file that specifies the target device and the JTAG interface. For example, if you want to debug an ARM-7 device connected to LPT1 port, you can create a project file like this:

    project Default is
       for Target use "arm-eabi";
       for Runtime ("Ada") use "ravenscar-sfp";
       for Main use ("main.adb");
       package Builder is
          for Switches ("Ada") use ("-g", "-O0");
       end Builder;
       package Debugger is
          for Connection use ("jlink", "-device", "ARM-7", "-if", "lpt1");
       end Debugger;
    end Default;

Save this file as default.gpr in your project folder. Then, open GNU GNAT and load this project file. You can then compile, run, and debug your Ada program using the standard commands.
 
### ADI ES12107
 
ADI ES12107 is a 2-port serial to parallel adapter that allows you to connect serial devices such as terminal emulators or modems to a parallel port. It can also be used as a JTAG interface for debugging ARM devices. To use it with H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to download and install ADI ES
