Trainer Megaman X6 Pc is a great tool for Mega Man X6 fans who want to explore the game in different ways. However, using the trainer also means that you will miss out on some of the challenges and rewards that the game offers. If you want to play the game without cheats, you will need some tips and tricks to overcome the difficulties and secrets that Mega Man X6 has.

One of the most important aspects of Mega Man X6 is choosing the right order of stages and bosses. Each boss has a weakness to a certain weapon, and each stage has different items and upgrades that can help you progress. The best order to follow is:
<ul>
<li>Commander Yammark (use X-Buster) - You will get the Yammar Option weapon and the Blade Armor Legs upgrade.</li>
<li>Ground Scaravich (use Yammar Option) - You will get the Ground Dash weapon and the Blade Armor Helmet upgrade.</li>
<li>Blaze Heatnix (use Ground Dash) - You will get the Magma Blade weapon and the Shadow Armor Arms upgrade.</li>
<li>Blizzard Wolfang (use Magma Blade) - You will get the Ice Burst weapon and the Shadow Armor Legs upgrade.</li>
<li>Rainy Turtloid (use Ice Burst) - You will get the Meteor Rain weapon and the Shadow Armor Body upgrade.</li>
<li>Metal Shark Player (use Meteor Rain) - You will get the Metal Anchor weapon and the Shadow Armor Helmet upgrade.</li>
<li>Shield Sheldon (use Metal Anchor) - You will get the Guard Shell weapon and the Blade Armor Body upgrade.</li>
<li>Infinity Mijinion (use Guard Shell) - You will get the Ray Arrow weapon and the Blade Armor Arms upgrade.</li>
</ul>

Another important aspect of Mega Man X6 is rescuing Reploids. Reploids are friendly robots that are scattered throughout the stages, and they can give you extra lives, Nightmare Souls, or parts. Nightmare Souls are used to unlock new abilities for X or Zero, while parts are used to equip different enhancements for your character. However, rescuing Reploids is not easy, as they are often attacked by enemies or infected by Nightmares. If a Reploid is infected, it will turn purple and attack you. If a Reploid is killed by an enemy or a Nightmare, it will be gone forever. To rescue Reploids safely, you should use weapons that can stun enemies or Nightmares, such as Yammar Option, Ground Dash, or Metal Anchor. You should also use parts that can increase your speed or defense, such as Speedster, Hyper Dash, or Jumper.

A final tip for Mega Man X6 is to find secret portals. Secret portals are hidden entrances that lead to different areas of the stages, where you can find more items, upgrades, or bosses. Some of the secret portals are easy to spot, while others require you to use certain weapons or armors to access them. For example, in Commander Yammark's stage, there is a secret portal in the first area that can be opened by using Ground Dash on a cracked wall. In Blaze Heatnix's stage, there is a secret portal in the second area that can be reached by using Shadow Armor's air dash on a high platform. In Infinity Mijinion's stage, there is a secret portal in the third area that can be activated by using Ray Arrow on a switch. Some of the secret portals lead to optional boss fights against Dynamo or High Max, which can give you more Nightmare Souls or challenge your skills.

With these tips and tricks, you can enjoy Mega Man X6 without using Trainer Megaman X6 Pc. However, if you still want to use the trainer for fun or experimentation, feel free to do so. Just remember to backup your save files before using it, as it might cause some glitches or errors in your game.
